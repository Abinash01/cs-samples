# Extract Characters and Words From PDFs Using the LEADTOOLS PDFDocument Class

This sample demonstrates how to use the LEADTOOLS PDFDocument class to extract text from searchable PDF documents.
It displays each character in a list box and highlights the character in the image when selected. 
The character bounds are displayed in a text box just below the list box. 

This sample also shows you how to convert the characters into words. The words are also displayed in a list box 
and also highlighted when selected with their coordinates displayed in the same text box as the characters. 

This sample works with text-based PDFs and does not require OCR.
